in the next coming meetings we're going to have a bylaw to adopt the financial plan I yeah we pass the financial plan by resolution and then that becomes schedule a to the bylaw for the taxation thank you for that clearly a few concerns I have I wanted to share with counsel with this particular proposed 2025 financial plan I noted at least one resident got back to me actually there's a couple of them a few that had input questions to our Council but as you know we don't have question period we don't have delegations and we really have no mechanism for the public to engage with us but this one individual as you know it's in our agenda kind of hidden from the public but this one individual did submit comments to the CEO and express that those comments be how can I say publicly known so I'm just wondering when people submit comments because again we've eliminated question period we don't really have delegations to this special meeting so there's no opportunity for the public to engage with us at all but yet this individual took the effort to do I think a two or three page Exposition or series of questions for the financial plan but yet when they submitted them online this individual had the understanding that they would be posted publicly for people to share his concerns or maybe even respond to them but I think you know who I'm referring to I'm not sure if that individual wants me to to say that their name but I'm just wondering when people submits wasn't that supposed to be the mechanism where the public still has the opportunity to publicly have their concerns shared with the community in other words are we just now relying on Oak Bank Renton race for the community to engage with us this seems to be really the only mechanism I'm kind of frustrated at that because people are now calling me and saying Mark other than you expressing our concerns at these meetings there's no ability for the public to engage with not only the bureaucracy but with counseling in general and so for some council members they feel it's gone on deaf ears in other words they share those concerns with Council Representatives but they don't bring them up they don't share them and they don't respond to them and so they feel very frustrated they feel that the only mechanism now the only mechanism they have now are two things one to Institute recall legislation which of course won't happen very quickly and the second is to vote differently at the next election in October of 2026 so it's unfortunate that we've come to this situation where the public really is relegated to the Backwoods and and so my next point is with the provincial reassessment this year in 2025 we have an addition of 2 million dollars to our kitty and so we've taken upon us to find ways to spend that 2 million dollars and you know I came to cancel here wanting to sharpen my pencil as much as I could not to cut indiscriminately but to save taxpayers dollars on discretionary items in other words things that are not necessarily for the clear benefit of the ratepayers of our community and I've tried to do that but like in any democracy if they don't flow with the rest of those who vote for those things they end up in in the dungeon and don't get passed so I would suggest I would suggest that you know with this proposed budget I personally have seen that I'm going to have an 18% increase in my Municipal Taxes 18% and I don't have the biggest house in our municipality I guarantee you that my neighbor across the street has a house worth at least five times mine and they're going to go ballistic if they're rate increases 18% now I know that's not the average but some people are going to have 20% some are going to have 2% some are going to have 8% and they're going to wonder and asked us the question where we spending this money\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from transformers import
